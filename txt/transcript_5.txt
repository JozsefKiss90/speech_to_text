Hello guys it's me Alijah Cloudy here I am currently the most tired rather than runner player playing ranked you know which two and I'm here to teach you how to play Reinhardt today and win every single game you playing ranked. Ohh my credentials are I've currently rank three playing Overwatch 2IN ranked. Currently I'm ranked nine in European ladder only playing Reinhardt plus 80 hours in Reinhardt right now and.
About 240 wins on time.
So I'm going to explain how to win on Reinhardt every singular time today on this video. So I'm going to go over the basics of Reinhart. Here right now is 625 HP, have a few HP armor, have pure HP health armor. You take less time. It's very easy stuff. And then for your primary gone, I called my hammer gun because it's more cool right? So for your primary gun you have to hammer right? So you want to swing the hammer and just 85 damage per swing. It takes 3 swings to kill the tank.
Just the DPS in the game and it takes, it takes a lot of swings to kill a tank. Let's say you're swinging on a rhino and it's gonna take you 123456789, OK? And that's going to be important later. Why? I suggest that there. But that's like your primary button, right?
And then I would say your poke tool and how you farm all charge tool, fire strike, Fire strike is like a very, very sick ability at the basic level, right, Like you just throw a fire strike.
And you can't even charge. And you know what's too, because it's #2A version of the game. You have an extra first, so you just use Firestrike of cool down and like you just get through charts, you know? Then you have your next build is called the Charge and you're like pin forward and you're charging like turn around a little bit and you do that one there.
That's 225 damage, so you know most once at the end it's freezing again. And then you have you, what I like to call the utility tool. You hold shield and you block damage for yourself and your teammates. Shield is 1200 HP and regions when you don't take damage for a few seconds like this.
It's going to region, yeah.
No, no. For your ultimate ability problem, my favorite building the entire game is the earth shatter. You click queue and you stand the enemy for two seconds and they cannot move because they are stocked. OK, And then I'm gonna give you an advanced advice for every single ability. Let's start with the hammer. There's a lot of new players coming in the game and a lot of people don't know this. You see like Reinhardt swing. It's like this distance, right?
You see, there's a there's a lot. I'm going to give you an advice tip for every single building Reinhardt swing, there's like sort of distance, right? Like it looks like you cannot take the Winston, right? But if you swing like this, you hit the enemy further distances it. If you save your screen like this, you hit the enemy from further away.
An identifier strike Fire strikes is a very basic appeal that the fundamental level right? But the best way to use fire stick in my opinion is if you want Max damage TPF like this one, you Max damage DPS, compost Equisite or anyone you go swing swing fireside then you swing swing swing.
And look how fast Sikorski compared to speed of what you kill. Squishy compared to you. Just swing, swing, swing. Yeah, but because Fire Strike cancels your speaking ability, right? And this is how you DPS combo down at DPS, you first strike, swing, Firestrike. It's much faster to do DPS to cancel your hammer animation. With the Firestrike Tenfold charts, you can throw people off the map with charge pretty easily, right? So usually when I hit them in the wall. But let's say you pick.
Yeah, right. Like, sorry it's not gonna get the monster that you you have pin cancel, you can cancel the pin, right? So you click charge and then you pin and then you smacker of them up.
Like it is very.
It is very important that you smack them off the map though. Like let me show you again like I pin them up, you're still on the edge and then I smack them. Like smacking the character gives it extra momentum. You smack it in the way you pin it like this and then earth shatter let's so for an example a Winston. Winston has 500HP right like usually a few earth center and do this you can't kill him, you're still alive right? Like he has like 100 each bit but for the advanced.
Winston Advanced right here. Take how you can kill Winston. Sir, if you have this other thing in front of you, that does extra 250 damage, right?
I mean, there's extra 200. You have this thing inside it called. I like to call it the flop. There's like a small radius in front of it that does extra 200 damage. So if I do this, I can get damaged and you go really close to instant, don't go too close, talk. Sometimes it doesn't work a little bit of a distance, like here, and then you start at the Winston and then boom, boom instead because of the extra 200 damage.
And that's pretty much how Ryan ability disrupt. Just remember to fire strike, cancel their swings. Very important.
I'm gonna I'm gonna explain to you now strategies how to win and Reinhart with almost every just awesome now for Reinhardt here. There's a lot of things that happen. A lot of new players and you know a lot of older players to like make a big mistake with runner. Like you guys have 625 HP right and 1200 shield. So most of the time people are just going to sit here and let the shield get destroyed before letting your entire shield destroy. You have so much shelter to take damage with your health instead of the shield, just like the optimal way to play Reinhart.
I'm so example of this. Soon it's you take damage and when you when you're about to die you're sheltered die like if your child dies. When you're 625 HP you have misplaced the fight like you should be shielding until the bitter end. Like most of the time your shield will just type before about that. But if your shield types and your flesh you have not utilized your big help. This is another system. This is just wasting about charging. Right here you're about to see what you can do with charge cards like The Absolute Power of Reinhardt. Charge cancel like charge.
That's an incredible ability. Like, it opens Shriner to play like a dive hero, like here. You see in the Ohh, it's one you probably will not go for this one because of the Reinhardt and one tank. You know it's two you have to go on the squishies. Like you have to like the squeezes here. I could make a decision, right I could swing on the diva or go for the squeezes, but I have pin cancel so I can quickly reach the owner and I can pin cancel to plug the sleep.
Like this is what you have to you have to pin cancel on. If you're playing against Anna, you pin cancel Conan like pin cancer. Such a strong ability. You should always pin cancel on the enemy squishies and kill them instead of hitting the tank. Never. This is my #1 advice. Only hit the tank if you cannot reach any other character like. As you can see the device can dive my squishies like this device. A good player. He's going to dive my squishies and use it. Always dive there squeezes like here. Let me show you an example. I did cancel. I turn around. I slipped. I sealed the sleep.
Unnatural sleep into my shield because I use pin cans on the icon and then Anna is a free kill.
Boom. Enemy support. That is it. And then the fight goes on from there. But you got Dominic pillow support because you have to understand that if Reinhardt can swing on a squishy character, they're going to die.
Like Richard is a dive character. You have to dive. The best way to play tank and I can promise you is play Reinhardt. You need to play extremely aggressive in every single situation in the.
I'll show you another example and then I'll explain to you later how you should play tank in order to win more.
You're also you're another example about being a alpha tank player.
This might look really silly, but here on Nepal I always scout. Here I hold children. You can third perspective. See the joke?
So here I'm going to see the soldier come in and see what I do. This is how you need to think and act like if you're a tank player. I see the soldier come up and I soldiers that are killer.
I sold the children and kill him because this is what you do as a tank player. You need to deal with the squeezes. You need to be as a runner. You need to think like you're the most alpha child Kikuchi dumbest player in the whole world. Like, you have to believe in it and you have to do dumb stuff, like doing dumb stuff with you and Richard. Playing normal does not mean on Richard. It is so vital to you.
That you play.
As Thomas and acro as possible and right.
That is how you win. That is the Reinhart playstyle. Let me talk about the mentality of Reinhardt, how how you want, how you want to treat an approach every single rank.
As a Reinhardt player, you need to be aggressive on all two situations of the game.
If you're not aggressive, you're going to lose.
As a Reinhardt's, the best way to play the game and as any tank, is to be as aggressive as possible. Like the more aggressive the tank is, the more you're going to win. Sometimes you might feed and fail, but that's OK. Like, nobody's perfect. Nobody plays perfectly. But always, always, always be aggressive every single time you go. And Reinhart.
You have to make a move. You have to pin on the enemy backline, pin on the squeezes, hit the tank solos under the tank, move the point. Never be shielding your backline and doing nothing because this is a one time game. If your tank is shielding your back line, that means you're not doing anything.
And the best way to enable your DPS is not to shield them is to pin into the enemy team and swing on their excuses. If there is a reinhart on the enemy team, backline your DPS.
Are probably 3 firing if, but if the enemy tank is good, the tank will go on the DPS. But a lot of times people are going to panic and they're going to 5 Montpelier. And then you just need to do as much damage as you can and try to live as long as possible and your DPS should be able to clean the job. So always buy space, make moves. That is how you've been running.
As you can see here guys, these are my Rhinehart statistics. From 02 ranked, I have pretty much only played Reinhardt. Sometimes I play some other roles. As you can see, I have 81 hours on Reinhart already in the game. 2 1/2 weeks after lunch. And my next plate. Thank you Steve. Over 3 hours because there are two maps on play Reinhart on. I know it's crazy, but it does happen there. There's two optimal ways to do right. You go on the back line, you go crazy and you move to point. Or you tell your teammates to match. The covers don't die, guys. I'm going to move the point.
Little winner.
Don't die on the smooth point. That is a very good way to play Reinhart.
Those are the two major ways you mining rank this tank.
You know it's one tank should take space and go everywhere. But if you're playing payloads, a serial trial for example, like you see on point, like I see all these tank players pushing up and then they squeeze their stars on point in all its two you are the point, you will see it on the point. You're either going on the back line hinting in or you're moving the point. But most of the time on payload and hybrid.
But the payload is open on attack and defense. I recommend you just sit on the point.
That is very powerful. If you sit on the point. There is no character in the game that can kill runner. So very important part of time play is moving the point. It is the tank stop. Undeniably there is no other character that would move the point like 90% of the time. You should always always, always be on the points right?
As you can see from my POV, I'm just going to see them point here. I'm going to topple speed this and you just see how long I've stalled the point. Like you see enemy ball is under my backline here, enemy ball and Kyrie goes on my back line, but it does not matter, like the ball is going to die in my back line and I'm just sitting here living.
Like you see, it's over all repeat 30 seconds of the call.
I learned to double speed again. It's been 30 seconds into the game and they have not moved to build past the first corner. Now the ball is shooting me like the ball can do anything, like you're just sitting on the point. You have very powerful precision.
There's nothing they can do. Now your video is getting peaks. Here, you're sitting on the points. Sit on the point. Now you just hope here you hope your backline just diet. Your backline is dying right now. But that's OK. It's already been a minute. And because you stood on point for one minute and they have stolen no space, no point, and then you can recognize the point again. So guys, remember that sitting on the point is how you win in the game.
Getting kills does not matter.
The point is, the only thing that matters in the end is an extremely vital tip on tank. I can give you that. I'm going to show you how to retake space with Tryhard. Right. Let's look at the Midtown joke. Like, usually this is a very hard place to come up with. So you need a drastic matters, right? So I'm going to show you guys what you should every time you walk to take a joke. So you need to do very drastic moves here. OK? And here. My friend Anna, my boy Super has not a ********. So hearing the voice I was telling Tupac, yo, Are you ready to none on me? And the two process says yo-yo.
And then I'm going to pin and take space.
Also very good sleep, but super. But like this one. I mean, even if this monkey is not sleeping, you still hit the pin. Like when you need to take spaces right now you just spin on like a crazy guy and walk forward like a crazy dude. And that's why it takes place and we've beat the fight because I'm a crazy guy. This is an example of another thing. As a tank, it's really important sometimes not to die. If you don't tie. Fight is always winnable, like as a tank. There are two characters in the game that cannot die pretty fast. That is Flexport, AKA Arnoldson, Baptiste Moira and even Kirkconnell. Right? And they're stuck.
Thank those pre fight. It's extremely hard to win if you don't have like a four wooded Vantage flex support ties to extremely hard to win because you have no healing, right. So yeah, I'm going to show you a fight and then I'm going to explain to you what's really important, how I close this right here. Okay fairness.
Also solo stuttering people very, very quickly.
Like solar stuttering here. He's an extremely water kill because my back line is currently getting it. Let me pause here. Like right now it's looking really bad for us. I'm on point, but I know cuz I played a lot that I know one of my back liners though, and I know there's a Winston on my back line right now. So me stuttering to skill sorting is very important because the game is a 4V4 Now if I don't shatter and kill the Sergeant here and soldier no. Sold, they're probably losing.
So here I hear the trunk and at the bottom of my eye I see my teammates aren't spawn because the monkey jumped in and there's a trunk here. So I'm going to make the decision to run away and go to my team.
So here we are tributary. I lost my Flex support so I know we have really long, but here I click tab in game and I see that we almost have roll it. So here I make the call to my team that we should play the lift we have really I can touch the point. Also really important guys in overtime just to waste and clots fights. If you're a tank make sure you call. You're going to touch the point.
Because you touching the point allows your DPS to make plays as as you will see in this fight.
It allows your DPS to make a lot of plays. If you make sure you invite your teammates, know that you will have support. This goes back to the pointing here. Look what the enemy Winston is going to do.
Enemy Winston Thompson. My back line. I look at him here, but I know for a fact that he has ult. OK. I know that Winston assault. So me gonna go swing on the Winston is very bad. So here I just tell my team just try to leave. I'll touch the point because one of us has to That's the point. So right so I just believe in my back line that they're not going to die the Winston. So I'm going to go on the point and touch it. Right. Your job is a tank used to go on point.
And here is I know that there's like two people in my spot.
What I know for a fact is that the enemy has a key. Recall May, May and Winston in our spot. So I see the 10 alone on point here and I know I have to trade like two of my teammates are start here. If I just sit on the point, I'm going to lose like this is the tank mentality. If you have a chance to, if your backline is getting Dolph and you're a tank player, you don't want to peel. You need to kill the enemy backline.
Especially as Reinhardt. If you're playing Reinhardt in ranked and your back line is getting dope, there's nothing you can do. You have to pin on the enemy placard and try to trade. You have to do something like swinging on a Winston problem does nothing. This is the most important thing.
Peeling for your team is killing the enemy backline and their back line is at Senyera. So this fight I have killed their sorcerer once and now I'm going to kill them.
Right here, here, there, there. I'm in a mechanical mistake. I missed my first so.
And here I'm fighting for my life.
Like, this fight has been incredibly well played by myself, except that Firestrike ignore that.
Because but here the searching rolls into me and because I quite well with my shield.
As you can see here guys sometimes you need to drop seal to kite like I drop shield so I get some space, I swing on him to scare him away and then he then he can't push me anymore like he's too far for him to push. So I ran back after killing the 10:00 and I killed 13 Yetta and made I made their surgeon go back. I look at the amount of space.
Like the fight from it. From them killing two in our spawn, from me killing their chin and forcing their swords into go back all the way here And now it's just two. It's a 2V2 one point from a place where my two of my teammates were dead and they were all alive.
So I created absolutely incredible amount of space by going on the back line and now I'm back here to touch the point and now the fight is reset.
So let's look at the fight one more time. Yeah, I remember guys, I played. Thank you.
Most important thing that this the biggest mistake I see. People don't think they peel the back line like here me going on the Winston would have lost us again.
But here I see monkey jumping. I'm like, Nah, there's nothing I can do. Yes, primal rights, like a good Winston player doesn't jump like that if he doesn't have, all right?
And then I see the kill feed really soon here, here. I see my surgeon die and I'm like, and then I see the kind of alone. So I'm like, I have to kill this stuff.
Like buck flying dilution ****** ** first right there after.
Then my pretty gives me a really good back here. I got the swords and then I leave. And then in the midst, just like through your life, and they have to go back. So peel piking backline.
Just like just like fundamentals, how you win on tank, like absolute fundamental of again, you go on enemy backline, we tank, you're going to win, you don't go on enemy backline, you lose and that's how you gain as our guys that that's the secret behind all of it. You play around point and when you can you trade the back line that's always two tank.
Remember the second trial clip? You moved the point or your pin on back line.
And that's how you been on tankers as our every time you top ten Reinhart only 83 hours 58 win rate and that's how you do it cuz.
Those are the secrets to tanking OSU from a guy I don't. There's no guy on in the entire ladder who has more games than me. So this is truly the most fundamental play how to play Reinharts.
If I open the leaderboard, I have 437 games played. There is not a single person who is even close to me right now. Well, one of them is 292, but still it's like no one even has 300 games played.
So I have played a lot of tank and being top 10 for like most of the games. So the most important part of Reinhard as a tank applies to everything to be honest is to pin and go on the squeezes and stay on the point. When you need to stay on the point you need to trade aggro. When your squeezes are getting off. Do not peel your squeezes. If there's a diva and tracer, go on the enemy squeezes.
And that is how you're going to win a lot more aggression of state point trade backline easy wins. I'll be guys enjoy this tutorial on how to win on tank. Maybe you guys are gonna start winning like me now. Maybe I'll meet you guys in my top ten new games I stream daily 10 hours a day playing Reinhardt. So in the waste of the time you know it's too. So in the future I plan to make tank matchup guides with every single time in the game and they come up. So if you guys like that let me know in the comics and like subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next one. Our stream. I ain't. Bye bye.

And that's pretty much how Ryan ability disrupt. Just remember to fire strike, cancel their swings. Very important.
I'm gonna I'm gonna explain to you now strategies how to win and Reinhart with almost every just awesome now for Reinhardt here. There's a lot of things that happen.

I sold the children and kill him because this is what you do as a tank player. You need to deal with the squeezes. You need to be as a runner. You need to think like you're the most alpha child Kikuchi dumbest player in the whole world. Like, you have to believe in it and you have to do dumb stuff, like doing dumb stuff with you and Richard. Playing normal does not mean on Richard. It is so vital to you.
That you play.

As you can see here guys, these are my Rhinehart statistics. From 02 ranked, I have pretty much only played Reinhardt. Sometimes I play some other roles. As you can see, I have 81 hours on Reinhart already in the game. 2 1/2 weeks after lunch. And my next plate. Thank you Steve. Over 3 hours because there are two maps on play Reinhart on. I know it's crazy, but it does happen there. There's two optimal ways to do right. You go on the back line, you go crazy and you move to point. Or you tell your teammates to match. The covers don't die, guys. I'm going to move the point.
Little winner.
Don't die on the smooth point. That is a very good way to play Reinhart.
Those are the two major ways you mining rank this tank.
You know it's one tank should take space and go everywhere. But if you're playing payloads, a serial trial for example, like you see on point, like I see all these tank players pushing up and then they squeeze their stars on point in all its two you are the point, you will see it on the point. You're either going on the back line hinting in or you're moving the point. But most of the time on payload and hybrid.
But the payload is open on attack and defense. I recommend you just sit on the point.
That is very powerful. If you sit on the point. There is no character in the game that can kill runner. So very important part of time play is moving the point. It is the tank stop. Undeniably there is no other character that would move the point like 90% of the time. You should always always, always be on the points right?
As you can see from my POV, I'm just going to see them point here. I'm going to topple speed this and you just see how long I've stalled the point. Like you see enemy ball is under my backline here, enemy ball and Kyrie goes on my back line, but it does not matter, like the ball is going to die in my back line and I'm just sitting here living.
Like you see, it's over all repeat 30 seconds of the call.
I learned to double speed again. It's been 30 seconds into the game and they have not moved to build past the first corner. Now the ball is shooting me like the ball can do anything, like you're just sitting on the point. You have very powerful precision.
There's nothing they can do. Now your video is getting peaks. Here, you're sitting on the points. Sit on the point. Now you just hope here you hope your backline just diet. Your backline is dying right now. But that's OK. It's already been a minute. And because you stood on point for one minute and they have stolen no space, no point, and then you can recognize the point again. So guys, remember that sitting on the point is how you win in the game.
Getting kills does not matter.
The point is, the only thing that matters in the end is an extremely vital tip on tank. I can give you that. I'm going to show you how to retake space with Tryhard. Right. Let's look at the Midtown joke. Like, usually this is a very hard place to come up with. So you need a drastic matters, right? So I'm going to show you guys what you should every time you walk to take a joke. So you need to do very drastic moves here. OK? And here. My friend Anna, my boy Super has not a ********. So hearing the voice I was telling Tupac, yo, Are you ready to none on me? And the two process says yo-yo.
And then I'm going to pin and take space.
Also very good sleep, but super. But like this one. I mean, even if this monkey is not sleeping, you still hit the pin. Like when you need to take spaces right now you just spin on like a crazy guy and walk forward like a crazy dude. And that's why it takes place and we've beat the fight because I'm a crazy guy. This is an example of another thing. As a tank, it's really important sometimes not to die. If you don't tie. Fight is always winnable, like as a tank. There are two characters in the game that cannot die pretty fast. That is Flexport, AKA Arnoldson, Baptiste Moira and even Kirkconnell. Right? And they're stuck.
Thank those pre fight. It's extremely hard to win if you don't have like a four wooded Vantage flex support ties to extremely hard to win because you have no healing, right. So yeah, I'm going to show you a fight and then I'm going to explain to you what's really important, how I close this right here. Okay fairness.
Also solo stuttering people very, very quickly.
Like solar stuttering here. He's an extremely water kill because my back line is currently getting it. Let me pause here. Like right now it's looking really bad for us. I'm on point, but I know cuz I played a lot that I know one of my back liners though, and I know there's a Winston on my back line right now. So me stuttering to skill sorting is very important because the game is a 4V4 Now if I don't shatter and kill the Sergeant here and soldier no. Sold, they're probably losing.
So here I hear the trunk and at the bottom of my eye I see my teammates aren't spawn because the monkey jumped in and there's a trunk here. So I'm going to make the decision to run away and go to my team.
So here we are tributary. I lost my Flex support so I know we have really long, but here I click tab in game and I see that we almost have roll it. So here I make the call to my team that we should play the lift we have really I can touch the point. Also really important guys in overtime just to waste and clots fights. If you're a tank make sure you call. You're going to touch the point.
Because you touching the point allows your DPS to make plays as as you will see in this fight.
It allows your DPS to make a lot of plays. If you make sure you invite your teammates, know that you will have support. This goes back to the pointing here. Look what the enemy Winston is going to do.
Enemy Winston Thompson. My back line. I look at him here, but I know for a fact that he has ult. OK. I know that Winston assault. So me gonna go swing on the Winston is very bad. So here I just tell my team just try to leave. I'll touch the point because one of us has to That's the point. So right so I just believe in my back line that they're not going to die the Winston. So I'm going to go on the point and touch it. Right. Your job is a tank used to go on point.
And here is I know that there's like two people in my spot.
What I know for a fact is that the enemy has a key. Recall May, May and Winston in our spot. So I see the 10 alone on point here and I know I have to trade like two of my teammates are start here. If I just sit on the point, I'm going to lose like this is the tank mentality. If you have a chance to, if your backline is getting Dolph and you're a tank player, you don't want to peel. You need to kill the enemy backline.
Especially as Reinhardt. If you're playing Reinhardt in ranked and your back line is getting dope, there's nothing you can do. You have to pin on the enemy placard and try to trade. You have to do something like swinging on a Winston problem does nothing. This is the most important thing.
Peeling for your team is killing the enemy backline and their back line is at Senyera. So this fight I have killed their sorcerer once and now I'm going to kill them.
Right here, here, there, there. I'm in a mechanical mistake. I missed my first so.
And here I'm fighting for my life.
Like, this fight has been incredibly well played by myself, except that Firestrike ignore that.
Because but here the searching rolls into me and because I quite well with my shield.
As you can see here guys sometimes you need to drop seal to kite like I drop shield so I get some space, I swing on him to scare him away and then he then he can't push me anymore like he's too far for him to push. So I ran back after killing the 10:00 and I killed 13 Yetta and made I made their surgeon go back. I look at the amount of space.
Like the fight from it. From them killing two in our spawn, from me killing their chin and forcing their swords into go back all the way here And now it's just two. It's a 2V2 one point from a place where my two of my teammates were dead and they were all alive.
So I created absolutely incredible amount of space by going on the back line and now I'm back here to touch the point and now the fight is reset.
So let's look at the fight one more time. Yeah, I remember guys, I played. Thank you.
Most important thing that this the biggest mistake I see. People don't think they peel the back line like here me going on the Winston would have lost us again.
But here I see monkey jumping. I'm like, Nah, there's nothing I can do. Yes, primal rights, like a good Winston player doesn't jump like that if he doesn't have, all right?
And then I see the kill feed really soon here, here. I see my surgeon die and I'm like, and then I see the kind of alone. So I'm like, I have to kill this stuff.
Like buck flying dilution ****** ** first right there after.
Then my pretty gives me a really good back here. I got the swords and then I leave. And then in the midst, just like through your life, and they have to go back. So peel piking backline.
Just like just like fundamentals, how you win on tank, like absolute fundamental of again, you go on enemy backline, we tank, you're going to win, you don't go on enemy backline, you lose and that's how you gain as our guys that that's the secret behind all of it. You play around point and when you can you trade the back line that's always two tank.
Remember the second trial clip? You moved the point or your pin on back line.
And that's how you been on tankers as our every time you top ten Reinhart only 83 hours 58 win rate and that's how you do it cuz.
Those are the secrets to tanking OSU from a guy I don't. There's no guy on in the entire ladder who has more games than me. So this is truly the most fundamental play how to play Reinharts.
If I open the leaderboard, I have 437 games played. There is not a single person who is even close to me right now. Well, one of them is 292, but still it's like no one even has 300 games played.
So I have played a lot of tank and being top 10 for like most of the games. So the most important part of Reinhard as a tank applies to everything to be honest is to pin and go on the squeezes and stay on the point. When you need to stay on the point you need to trade aggro. When your squeezes are getting off. Do not peel your squeezes. If there's a diva and tracer, go on the enemy squeezes.
And that is how you're going to win a lot more aggression of state point trade backline easy wins. I'll be guys enjoy this tutorial on how to win on tank. Maybe you guys are gonna start winning like me now. Maybe I'll meet you guys in my top ten new games I stream daily 10 hours a day playing Reinhardt. So in the waste of the time you know it's too. So in the future I plan to make tank matchup guides with every single time in the game and they come up. So if you guys like that let me know in the comics and like subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next one. Our stream. I ain't. Bye bye.
