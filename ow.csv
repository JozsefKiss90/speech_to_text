1;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Let's start this video off with wrecking balls, primary fire, quad cannons, good damage, bad weapons spread, even worse, fall off damage and a very slow reload speed.
2;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Moving on to his first ability, transform AKA ball mode and crab mode.
3;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Ball mode gives him increased movement speed and hides the hamster head, meaning there's no way to headshot the Hammond While in ball mode.
4;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;You automatically reload after a certain amount of time, going in and out of ball mode while mid reload.
5;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;We'll restart the whole reload process, so make sure you learn that timing.
6;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Or you could just watch his ammo for the numbers going up.
7;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;It's also worth noting that you reload slightly faster in crab mode.
8;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;However, you also become easier to shoot at, so only go for the crab reload when you're not being shot at.
9;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;That way you become a harder target while rolling around.
10;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Now that we covered that, let's skip on over to the ability of pile driver to make it work.
11;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;We just need to input Crouch while having a certain amount of distance between ball and the floor.
12;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Landing the Pile Driver knocks up enemies in an arc towards ball.
13;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;The damage starts at 100 and falls off the further you are from the target.
14;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Here's an important tip, You can roll off a ledge and pile driver back on.
15;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;It's also faster to hold the Pile Driver input instead of spam pressing them.
16;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Now for the ability that makes Wrecking Ball a Wrecking Ball Grappling Hook.
17;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Unfortunately, grapple does not work on floors or enemies.
18;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;However, it still has plenty of uses.
19;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Grapple high.
20;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Or height and grapple at ball level for speed.
21;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Once ball reaches a certain speed, he gets this fireball animation which deals damage and knockback.
22;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;You can hold on to grapple and do this multiple times with one cooldown, but be careful because there's a six second timer before it detaches.
23;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;His last ability is Adaptive Shields.
24;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Upon use, Wrecking Ball gets 100 temporary health.
25;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;He gets 100 extra health for every enemy within range.
26;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Also, if you didn't know, this indicator tells you how many.
27;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Means are within range.
28;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;The best uses for this ability are during engagements.
29;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;That means when you roll through the enemy team, or when you go for a pile driver.
30;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Pro tip, it's better to use the Adaptive Shield before the pile driver.
31;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;That way any damage you take is on your temporary health.
32;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;It's also worth using sometimes in one V ones because you get a 200 HP bonus, but also because it gives the enemy less old charge.
33;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Finally, we can move on to Wrecking Ball's Ultimate Minefield, as the name might suggest.
34;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;For Wrecking Ball poops out tiny balls that collectively make up a minefield.
35;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Upon using the ultimate, the mine, shoot out the top of ball in a sprout or umbrella shaped formation.
36;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Minefield is also one of the few ultimates that you can immediately farm after using the higher ball is when activated, the further the minds will spread.
37;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Very spread minds are harder for the enemy to destroy and avoid, but they also become less lethal since enemies are less likely to get knocked from one line to the other.
38;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;On the opposite end, close minds.
39;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;They're very deadly, but easier to destroy and avoid.
40;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;In most situations you'll want the spread you get from a minimal height.
41;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Minefield Pile driver, What's Minefield?
42;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Power Driver you might ask?
43;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Well, it's a combo as old as time, where basically you use minefield and then you pile Driver.
44;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Who would have guessed?
45;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;The idea is you get high enough for the minds of spread a bit, and then the follow-up pile Driver basically makes it harder for enemies to get away before the mines activate, and just like that, you now.
46;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Know how to play Wrecking Ball better than most people in quickplay.
47;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;What's that?
48;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;You wanna play him in Competitive, huh?
49;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Slow down, slow down.
50;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;I taught you how to play Wrecking Ball, not how to play tank.
51;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;I mean, sure, technically he's in a tank role, but if you're just playing him without a brain, you're basically just playing DPS.
52;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;But worry not, this next part of the video will teach you how to play ball like an intellectual how to ball in Overwatch 2.
53;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;The general idea can be summed up by the three's scout, set up and strike.
54;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;I previously made a video on this in Overwatch.
55;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;One, but here's the gist of it.
56;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Step one, you wanna start every fight by scouting what the enemy team is playing and where they are pathing Step 2 with the information you get from scouting, you then want to get set up.
57;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;This is just a simple way of saying to discreetly position yourself behind at an angle or just on high ground to engage the enemy.
58;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;And last but not least, step three, strike the enemy.
59;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;You can strike by rolling through them or flying in with a pile driver.
60;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Congratulations, You now know a very condensed version of how to ball in Overwatch 2.
61;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Scout, set up and strike.
62;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Think you're ready to hit Grandmaster?
63;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Think again.
64;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;That was just a simplified version of how to ball.
65;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;If you really want to be a top baller, you're going to want to stick around for this next part.
66;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;When playing Wrecking Ball, you're either an attacker or defender.
67;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Let me explain.
68;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Starting with defender.
69;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;When you win a team fight and your team has control over the objective, you have what's called defenders advantage.
70;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Which Simply put, just means the enemy has to come to your part of the map as Wrecking Ball.
71;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;It's very easy to use third person peak to scout where the enemy team is pathing.
72;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;You'll want to then get set up near a place where that team has to squeeze through and as they do, bam, that's when you strike.
73;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;The reason you strike here and not over there is because here your teammates can actually shoot at them.
74;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Hey, look at that.
75;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;We just made a full circle back to the three-step thingy.
76;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;I guess we're done here, right?
77;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;No.
78;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;No, that was the easy part.
79;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Now how do you do this as an attacker, whether it be a push map, an escort, a hybrid, a twosie, I mean push map.
80;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;You're gonna want to remember one thing to run it down main.
81;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;There's a time and place for running it down main, but 90% of the time you're going to want a path from the sides.
82;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;The reason you do this is you need a setup to get value going Main.
83;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Every player on the enemy team is going to see you and click on you, whereas if you come from the sides, maybe 1 or 0.
84;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Players click on you and boom, you scout for your target and then you strike them.
85;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;So when you think about it, attacking is almost like 4 steps.
86;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Set up scout, setup, strike.
87;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Congratulations, you now mastered the three s s and you have a good grasp of both attacker and defender playstyles.
88;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;So now let's speed run some special rules when setting up.
89;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;If you run into an enemy, ask yourself this can I kill this person?
90;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;If the answer is yes, then kill them.
91;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;If the answer is no, then immediately run past them and grab health packs as needed.
92;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Which reminds me, health packs.
93;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Learn where they all are.
94;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;These guys will probably heal you more than your actual healers.
95;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;So when should you go back to your healers to get healed?
96;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Mostly when fights are over or all the health packs are on cooldown.
97;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;You know the scoped heroes, They're killing my whole team.
98;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;How do I deal with that?
99;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;You deal with it.
100;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Dive the snipers as often as possible to give them as few easy shots as you can.
101;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;They might get helped.
102;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Which is OK, You're making space when you dive them.
103;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;Just don't die for it.
104;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;OK, one last thing before you come to my stream and say it.
105;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;You know there's only one tank now.
106;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;My team just dies and asked me to swap shield.
107;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;What do I do?
108;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;And to that my friend, I say skill issue Wrecking Ball is fast enough to do everything I mentioned before someone dies, so just pick up the slack.
109;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;But in the event that you do lose someone early, that's where you have to make a judgment call to strike anyways or stay set up and wait for the regroup.
110;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, Wrecking Ball.
111;1;sanyi;Player;Top500;Overwatch;Wrecking ball;All;Tank;In a nutshell, if you enjoyed this video, you can show your thanks by striking that like subscribe and bell icon.
